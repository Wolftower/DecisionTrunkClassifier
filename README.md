This package contains the pre-release R-implementation of the Decision Trunk Classifier. The algorithm can be used to perform binary classification on numeric data, e.g. the result of a gene expression profiling experiment. Classification is based on so-called decision trunks, which consist of a sequence of decision nodes. For each decision node two threshold T1 and T2 are calculated. These thresholds are associated to two outgoing edges to classification nodes (one for each class). Observations with feature value less than T1 or greater than T2 are classified, and the rest are passed by a third outgoing edge to the next decision node in the trunk. The last decision node only has two outgoing edges to classification nodes.
